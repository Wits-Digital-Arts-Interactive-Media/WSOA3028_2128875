            <h2>WHAT DO I WANT FROM THIS?</h2>
            <p>
                For this project I was trying to keep things basic. I wanted to emulate something that would get the point across but would also be aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I will walk you through what I did to eventually get the outcome that I got.

            <h2>GOAL ALIGNMENT</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for this project was to create a website that best represented me and what I stand for. I wanted to explore unusual colour pallettes that aren’t often seen in websites. This website has a lot of writing and I wanted the colours and theme to take away the aspect of familiarity that one associates with every other website. I wanted mine to be unique and eye catching.

            <h2>INFORMATION STRUCTURE AND USER FLOW</h2>
            <p>
                To start the website I used a homepage as the anchor for everything. I wanted users to have an element of choosing which page follows after the main page but I also structured this website accordingly.
            </p>

            <div class="po-item">
                <img src="./images/lfWireframe.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            
            <p>
                I started with the blog page to primarily get all of the reading out of the way. There are 13 blogs and I didn’t want the user to constantly scroll through them all so I decided to separate them all into their own pages. Normally I would add a picture like I displayed in my wireframes but there were just too many and I had the fear of putting too much on the screen. I just opted for simple buttons for each blog post and called it a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also wanted the user to read what I had to do first in order for the completion of this website to come to fruition.
            </p>
            <p>
                I followed with the design section to further expand on the design process and decisions I had to make. I will tell you that wireframing is not an easy task to do but fortunately it is a section whereby I excel at. From drafting diagrams to adding images and text, I enjoy putting everything together to make one beautiful masterpiece.
            </p>
            <p>
                I followed it up with the essay section. I didnt want the user to be bombarded with text so I made sure to space out pure text from text with pictures. Staring at a screen is not really fun so I decided to put pure texts away from each other. My essay section mainly has 3 sections. One as an anchor and two more pages for each essay.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last section here is the profile section. I put this last in order for the user to go through my work first before seeing me. I want them to judge my craft before they see my face in order to eliminate biases upon first glance. This section represents me as an individual and what I am about. It also includes my portfolio that ranges from wireframes of other projects to my artwork.
            </p>

            <div class="po-item">
                <img src="./images/wireframe.png" alt="">
            </div>

        <section class="backG3">
            <h2>LIST OF ELEMENTS</h2>
            <p>
                Usually I would discuss this when I added my wireframes but I will discuss I here. This website mainly includes a lot of buttons. Buttons are the main way of navigation here . I also tried to include a scroll element for this assignment because I wanted a bit more for the user to explore. As minimal as the User Interaction is here, I wanted this website to be simplistic in nature. I have backgrounds and images for the user to look at but otherwise that’s basically it. Like I have stated before, this website has a lot of writing involved and this was just a nicer way repackaging it.

            <h2>STYLE GUIDE AND PROCESS</h2>
            <p>
                This project was a semester long project so each assignment we were focusing on different languages that build up a website. I mainly went in blind with no clear structure in mind until later on the project. I wanted five pages for each section. I didn’t want the element of doom scrolling. I wanted interaction and so I went with the basic website layout that includes pages rather than sections.
            </p>

            <div class="po-item">
                <img src="./images/ColourPallette.png" alt="">
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The inspiration for this project came from Pinterest. I love the colour green and have modelled majority of my internet presence around it. I went for an Old Money aesthetic and looked up inspiration from catalogues from brands like Ralph Lauren, Christian Louboutin, as well as luxury boutiques. The colours are very rich and eye catching. So I decided to mix dark emerald green with maroon, crimson red and dull beige to conceive the colour palette for this project. I decided that the title or h1 of my project should be crimson red to catch the eye, due to the fact that my title background is a dark image. I made each section different background colours to highlight the change of topic or tone of the section.
