        <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
        <p>
            I designed these wireframes for both website and mobile screen so that it would be easier to implement when it's time to make the website responsive.
            I have three pages done so far, the Home,Design and Blog pages. I started with these because these are the ones I have worked on so far.
            I will continue with the other frames when they are compulsory.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did 2 sections. One is the low perosity wireframe which includes basic shapes and shades of grey to indicate where everything will go.
            The other one includes the deatails of the page and how it will look. The light grey squares indicate the header and the footer which is where nav bars 
            and other information will go. The darker shades will indicate information. The darkest shade or black, will show the blog post images.
        </p>

        <h2>IxD Process</h2>
        <p>
            My IxD process is best illustrated in this image below. I have already established this process in the Week 4 blog.

        <h3>GOAL ALIGNMENT</h3>
        <p>
            For this website I would like to have a fully functional website that uses JavaScript for all navigation and a fully readable and ethical site using CSS. I want my website to be as reactive as possible, preferably similar to the Tesla website. 
        </p>
        <h3>CONTENT MAPPING</h3>
        <p>
            As shown in the map I drew out, my website will have buttons and link connecting each page to another. This will be achieved by the javascript navigation. The navbar will be present in each page, allowing the user to go through whichever page they want.
        </p>
        <h3>USER FLOW</h3>
        <p>
            So, I modelled 2 screens to show mobile and PC. I tried to make mobile just as good as the PC by incorporating the same element keeping in mind about the limitations of the Mobile screen size as opposed to the pc. The main difference between mobile and pc would be the fact that I have included a button that will be fixed at the top of the screen. When pressed, this button will display the navbar to the different pages. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I made the navbar on the pc screen to display buttons across and fixed so that users will be able to switch between pages easily. I will also include a javascript function that creates smooth transitions between screens but for now I just stuck to demonstrating the javascript through the navbar.
        </p>
        <p>I had to update the wireframes in order to further simplify them in order to run smoothly</p>

        <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
        <h3>Websites and inspiration</h3>
        <p>
            I drew inspiration from the apple website with how simplistic it is and how straightforward the UI and navigation are.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first website I decided to look at as per my previous iteration was the Apple website. I love the style choice of simplicity. It has a very minimalist aesthetic going and it utilises white space quite well. It is simple but informative and gets the point across quite easily. The style choice of the UI also intrigued me as it is easy for users to navigate through the website.
