        <h1>User Interface and User Experience</h1>
        <p>
            "As UI/UX designers, we hold a profound responsibility to design with empathy,
            considering the diverse needs and experiences of all users." - Whitney Hess
        </p>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            Technology has furthered our lives as human beings to a point where we no longer
            need to read manuals on how to use certain products and would rather figure
            things out as we go. This is largely attributed to the fact that the User Interface is
            designed to allow us easy access to whatever we want, whether its searching for
            apps, clicking on apps, or navigation.
        </p>
        <P>
            Good User Interface is integral when it comes to satisfactory User Experience,
            but what happens when we encounter Interface that is not so usable or ethical in
            is presentation and functionality?
        </P>
        <p>
            In this essay User Interface and User Experience will be discussed through
            analysing and dissecting the South African Home Affairs website. Using the
            course material with readings, this essay will explore what good UI/UX is made
            up of, along with examples of why this website is unethical and not well planned
            out to be consumed by everybody considering that it is a website that the entire
            country uses or has to go through.
        </p>
        <h2>HOME AFFAIRS ONLINE: WHAT WENT WRONG</h2>
        <p>
            For this essay I chose to analyse the South African Home Affairs website. In my
            opinion, I chose this website because it is by far the most unusable website I have
            came across. Using the different Laws, I will explain why it is that I feel this way.
            In the journal <strong>LAWS OF UX: USING PSYCHOLOLGY TO DESIGN BETTER
            PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</strong> by Jon Yablonski, He underlines the core
            psychological principles used to create better User experience for the user and
            what each website should look like.
        </p>
        <h3>FITT'S LAW</h3>
        <p>
            Fitt’s Law, according to Yablonski, is making sure that whatever you set as a
            target for the viewer to see or interact with is big enough
            for the user to select. targets (Yablonski, 2024).
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of this would be if the target is an options menu. Yablonski states that when presenting the user
            with options, the options must clear enough for the user to interact with and making sure each one is readable
            and is isolated enough for the user to be able to understand the information displayed and act
            accordingly (Yablonski, 2024).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Home Affairs Online does not seem to apply this law. As shown in figure 1, there seems to be very little
            spacing between these options. The spacing between each option is very small and if the user did not see the curser change to a hand
            instead of the select tool, They probably would have thought it was just a body of
            writing. We can also see that this is also apparent in figure 2, whereby the options
            have a similar size and colour to a point where it looks like one long banner. It is
            only when you hover does it show the reality of those images being options.
        </p>
        <p>
            These figures already show us that the home affairs website disregards these laws
            and does what it thinks is functional when in reality it is not.
        </p>
        <h3>HICK’S LAW</h3>
        <p>
            In the journal, Hick’s Law is described by Yablonski as the idea of removing
            multiple options to be replaced with a few meaningful ones that make it easier for
            the user to quickly make a decision (Yablonski, 2024). Not only does it help the
            user decide faster, but it also makes room for deeper evaluation and decision
            making to occur. It allows the user to process the options thoroughly before
            making a decision, unlike there being many options that end up confusing the
            user and wasting time that could be spent on another part of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            In figure 1 we see this with there being too many options to choose from. The
            way in which these options are presented feel overwhelming to me as a user. It
            made me not want to spend any more time on that section of the website because
            I was too lazy to read through all those options. As someone who is visually
            impaired, I found it really difficult to read through these options without repeating
            the same option when reading due to how similar they look.
        </p>
        <h2>ETHICS AND THE BASICS Figure 3: Shows the South African Home affairs homepage.</h2>
        <p>
            As you can see in figure 3, this is the South African Home Affairs website. There
            is a lot to unpack here. The first thing I found to be unethical was the background
            or white space of the website. It is adorned with a bunch line art that takes away
            from the focal point of the website which is the content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second point of analysis is that there is a lot of clutter in the focal point of
            the website which is very overwhelming for anyone who logs onto this site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third point of analysis is that There is no one place or area for the user to
            focus on. Everything is moving all at once which is quite distracting and
            disorienting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most images shown have the same colour or font, which makes it quite confusing.
            The fourth thing I would like to point out is that majority of this homepage
            consists of links to other sites or articles, of which most currently do not work.
        </p>
        <p>
            To sum it up, the readability of the website was quite bad due to how squashed
            everything was with little to no proper line spacing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legibility wasn’t too bad, it was average because the font was quite visible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website tried to have balance with its content by placing adverts and picture
            on either side of the centre but it just makes it look not so appealing as seen in
            figure 3. The location of these elements were done or placed so poorly. The
            images surrounding the body of writing in the middle completely overshadowed
            the writing and it just looks like a massive headache.
        </p>
        <p>
            The entire website felt really dense as most of the pictures are bigger that the
            important text shown.
        </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            To conclude this essay I would like to state that UI/UX ethics are very important
            when creating a website. As we look at the South African Home Affairs website,
            we see that making user-friendly and fair designs involves more than just making
            things look good or work well.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also means thinking about how easy it is for everyone to use, and making sure
            users feel empowered. When we use fair design practices, we can make digital
            experiences that not only help users but also follow good rules and encourage
            good interactions online.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used this essay to highlight how many ethical rules this website has broken
            which is quite a shame when you realise this website is one that everyone in the
            country has had to use at some point. A lot more could have been done if this
            website was designed with principles in mind.
