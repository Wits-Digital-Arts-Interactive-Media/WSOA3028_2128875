            In todays world, we as people have utilised the benefits of technology alongside
            each new wave of technological advancement. We are a generation of people who
            are proudly exclaiming that we no longer have to work twice as hard as our
            parents and grandparents, but rather we comfortable in our work spaces and have
            allowed the machines to do the majority of the heavy lifting. There is pride in
            knowing that we have new emerging tech giants who are constantly figuring out
            new ways to make our lives easier because at the end of the day that is what
            technology is, a tool to make our lives easier. With this achievement however,
            there are bound to be some downsides that may or may not shatter the illusion of
            the perfect tool. One of those downsides has created a large problem concerning
            employment and human labour being replaced by technological tools like AI. And
            we are now stuck asking the infamous question of many who have faced life
            changing dilemmas in their darkest of times, “What Now?”.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this essay, I will dive into the world of digital colonialism and human labour.
            This essay aims to shed light on the increasing problems within the workplace
            that faced by many who work and handle technology and navigate the digital
            space on behalf of their employers. Companies are now laying off majority of
            their staff in favour of the newly developing, ever expanding, knowledge-finding
            tools associated with Artificial Intelligence. To back up this proposed issue, I will
            be using Sareeta Amruta’s speech on "Tech Colonialism Today" delivered at the
            EPIC2019 conference on the EPIC (Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference)
            website. I will also be utilising an article on CNBC titled “Google lays off
            hundreds of ‘Core’ employees, moves some positions to India and Mexico”
            by Jennifer Elias. This article will be used as a real life example of these emerging
            issues in the workspace. Additional research will be conducted and articles will
            be referenced throughout this essay.

        <strong>KEY WORDS: Digital Colonialism, Artificial Intelligence</strong>

        <h2>DIGITAL COLONIALISM AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TECH WORKERS</h2>

        <p>
            According to the Boston Review, Digital colonialism is basically the control of
            digital and technological infrastructure by a few powerful Western corporations.
            This modern form of colonialism not only has control over data, but also
            communication networks, and digital economies. Unlike traditional colonialism,
            which involved the abuse and exploitation of physical territories, digital
            colonialism influences how information is accessed, processed, and shared
            (2023).
        </p>
        <p>
            In my understanding from the above text, digital colonialism is essentially huge
            companies trying to monopolise the market and creating cheap labour through the
            use of new technology that can get the work done by cutting down half the time
            and half the labour force. These companies seek to use this as a way of saving
            major costs while returning big profits. This in turn adds onto the growing rate of
            unemployment and is essentially terrible for the economy overall but great for the
            companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of this is the article published by J. Elias that details the digital
            colonisation that is currently occurring at Google. Google, the very popular and
            well known tech company popularised by the search engine feature and huge data
            return, has laid off employees in the west and relocating its business to the Eastern
            countries where labour is cheap (2024). According to Elias, Google has already
            laid off 200 of their core employees and is now relocating those positions to India
            and Mexico whereby the same amount of work and roles will be given but maybe
            at a cheaper cost than their initial employees who have now grown used to the
            average price a western employee would make at a tech company (2024).
        </p>
        <p>
            Elias is also stating that google is also stating that this major transformation is
            due to making its developer tools simpler while adding more AI features. Some
            teams like governance and protected data are being reduced, likely due to more
            rules and regulations. Google leaders say that advances in AI are causing these
            changes, calling it a big turning point. People losing their jobs can try to find other
            jobs within Google and get help with finding jobs elsewhere. Google wants to
            focus more on important products by “moving resources around” which in my
            understanding is trying to figure out how to achieve the objective without
            spending too much (2024).
        </p>

        <h2>DIGITAL COLONIALISM IN AFRICA</h2>

        <p>
            As much as I would hope this would only stop with google, there is an unfortunate
            reality that other major companies are utilising digital Colonialism. Worst of all,
            these companies are now pushing digital colonisation towards Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another example would be the very popular social media app called Facebook,
            founded by Mark Zuckerburg and owned by the Meta franchise. In a 2021 article
            by Bigtech, it was stated that Zuckerberg is engaging in digital colonialism
            through initiatives like Free Basics and major infrastructure investments in Africa
            and India. Free Basics offers limited free internet access, making Facebook the
            main gateway to the internet. This would make Facebook a primary internet
            provider of which it will compete with other local internet providers. In Africa,
            Facebook's $1 billion 2Africa undersea cable project raises concerns about
            control over digital infrastructure, while in India, Free Basics was banned due to
            net neutrality issues, though Facebook continues to seek influence in these
            regions (BigTechtopia, 2023).
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, these western companies have already planned for their
            “invasion” into the untapped digital market of African countries. South Africa
            alone may be one of the few technologically advanced African countries, but in
            comparison to the rest of the world, we are still leagues behind, which for us is
            unfortunate seeing as how there is a major gap to cover but very fortunate for
            emerging tech giants who plan to utilise this underdevelopment in their favour.
            South Africa has just entered the digital world but already there is a large
            competition between cheap foreign labour and Artificial Intelligence to worry
            about.
        </p>
        <p>
            And with all that is happening, we still have more digital “apartheid” based
            companies that are utilising this technology to further push racial agendas in
            South Africa. According to MIT Technology review, a local security company
            called Vumacam has partnered with international companies from the North to
            provide additional security with regards to cameras. Unfortunately, this has
            resulted in the company pushing racial agendas by creating divide between areas
            whereby the more predominantly black areas are targeted and the more upper
            class areas with a white majority are well protected and guarded (2023)
        </p>
        <p>
            These instances are doing more harm than good, and it really is giving these major
            companies a bad look with regards to the migration and integration into less
            developed ares.
        </p>

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

        <p>
            In conclusion, while technology has significantly improved our lives by reducing
            the need for manual labor and increasing efficiency, it also poses serious
            challenges. Digital colonialism is one such challenge, where powerful Western
            tech companies dominate global digital infrastructure and labor markets. This
            dominance leads to job losses and economic dependencies in less developed
            regions. For example, companies like Google and Facebook are shifting
            operations to countries like India and Africa, leveraging cheaper labor and
            minimal regulations. This trend not only exacerbates unemployment in Western
            countries but also imposes control over the digital landscape of developing
            nations, undermining local economies and innovation. Addressing these issues
            requires a balanced approach that ensures technological advancement benefits all,
            without exacerbating inequalities or creating new forms of exploitation.
