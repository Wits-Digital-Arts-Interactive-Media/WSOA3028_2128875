            <h3>The Road to Technocolonialism by Verdi</h3>
            <p>
                Verdi's article discusses technocolonialism, a modern twist on colonial practices through tech and data. The idea is that AI and digital tools often reinforce global power imbalances, especially hitting hard on countries in the Global South. Western companies usually develop and control these technologies, leading to data exploitation and digital surveillance that feels a lot like old-school colonial extraction.

            <p>
                Verdi argues that tech is often introduced in developing countries without considering local needs. This kind of technological imposition can strip away local control and deepen inequalities. The takeaway? We need to rethink how tech is rolled out globally, focusing on ethical standards that respect and empower local communities.

            <h3>Towards Decolonising Computational Sciences by Birhane and Guest</h3>
            <p>
                Birhane and Guest take a broader look at fields like AI, machine learning, and data science, highlighting systemic racism, sexism, and colonialism. They point out that these fields are historically exclusive and oppressive, particularly towards women of colour and other marginalized groups. They suggest that decolonizing these fields means recognizing their hostile, conservative nature and understanding that individual efforts alone won't cut it. We need structural changes to break down systemic inequalities and foster a genuinely diverse and inclusive scientific community.

            <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Reading these articles was a mix of eye-opening and uncomfortable. Here’s what stood out to me:
            </p>
            <p>
                Verdi’s discussion on technocolonialism highlighted the ethical duties of tech developers. It’s crucial to consider the broader impacts of deploying technology, especially in vulnerable regions. Tech should empower local communities, not exploit them. Making the computational sciences more inclusive isn’t just about representation. It’s about genuinely valuing and integrating diverse perspectives into the core of scientific research and tech development. This requires a fundamental shift in how we approach our work.

            <p>
                These readings made me reflect on my own practices. Am I contributing to a system that perpetuates inequality, or am I working towards creating a more inclusive and equitable digital world? This is a question all of us in tech should ask ourselves.
