            <h3>DISCUSSING WEBSITES</h3>
            <p>
                In this blog I will discuss what websites I have been looking at to write about in the essay. I have ultimately boiled the list down to two websites which are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Tesla website</li>
                <li>And the South African home affairs website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I was debating between the two and drew up a list of pros and cons for each one.
                Beginning with the Department of Home Affairs website, the website can be complex and challenging to navigate, especially for users who are not familiar with government processes or terminology. Important information is buried within multiple pages or difficult to find without specific guidance. The website has an extremely cluttered home page with some significant presentation issues. It’s difficult to look over everything because of this. The homepage is also cluttered with many links that do not work. The biggest issue with the website is that it is outdated. This results in many connective issues as well as incompatibility with various browsers. The positive aspects of the website are mainly the services that it provides. These services are integral to the lives of all South Africans. The site provides a platform for people with services related to citizenship, immigration, identity documents, passports, and other civil affairs matters. These services can be quite limited, forcing users to visit physical locations.

                The Tesla website serves as the primary online platform for Tesla, Inc. The website plays a crucial role in showcasing Tesla's products, services, technology, and company information to customers, investors, and the general public. The website is well made and has convenient features that make is user friendly. The home page is well put together and is pleasant to look at with its image background and neat presentation. At the top of the site is a nav bar with buttons that activate a drop down upon hovering. The various products that the site presents are properly organised by type, keeping everything separate and allowing for the user to navigate the site with little to no trouble. The site is well up to date and meets modern standards, there is nothing noticeably negative about the site’s functionality or connectivity.
