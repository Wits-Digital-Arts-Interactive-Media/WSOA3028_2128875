            <h3>READING: Moulthrop - 2003 - You Say You Want a Revolution Hypertext and the Laws of Media</h3>
            <p>
                This reading, to me, seemed like a continuation from the reading I chose for week 1. 
                It’s still explaining or rather reiterating what hypertext is, except in this reading it is further expanded upon. 
                Moulthrop expands on this argument by exploring the concept of hypertext, a technology allowing non-linear access to information. 
                He discusses its historical development, from early concepts by Vannevar Bush to Theodor Holm Nelson's ambitious project, Xanadu. 
                Moulthrop reflects on the reception of hypertext, its potential societal impact, and the challenges in realizing its full potential. 
                He considers the cyclic nature of technological trends and the perpetual desire for the "next big thing" in postmodern culture. 
                Moulthrop also raises questions about the political and social implications of hypertextual societies, including issues of authority and access. 
                Overall, he prompts readers to critically engage with the implications of hypertextual technologies for culture, politics, and social order. 
                From this reading I have gathered that Moulthrop, Nelson and Fruin all expand hypertext as a form of media. 
                Moulthrop, however, explores the options of the outputs that come from inputting something in the hypertext. 
                Each subheading describes either actions or inputs that can be used by the hypertext. 
                These subheadings include phrases such as “What does hypertext enhance or intensify?”, “What does hypertext displace or render obsolete?”, “What does hypertext become when taken to its limit?”. 
                These are questions that could be answered by actually inputting something to hypertext to generate an answer. However there’s also a lingering feeling of fear when Moulthrop asks these questions. 
                It feels as though there is an underlying warning about the dangers of expanding hypertext or using it in an unethical manner.

            <h3>LECTURE VIDEO AND SLIDES: </h3>
            <p>
                The lecture video was based on Human Centred Design and how to create reasonable and ethical designs. 
                The video mainly talked about the designs of doors and how majority of the doors are designed with aesthetic in mind instead of functionality. 
                Through highlighting the importance of good door designs to combat the shitty ones that are quite frankly everywhere, I was able to get the understanding of creating good UI and good hypertext navigation is vital for good user Experience. 
                The lecture slides highlighted the importance of links, inputs, and outputs. In order for a hypertext site to be interesting, there must be areas of input and output to keep the user engaged. 
                Some inputs and outputs include Mouse Events (click), UI (scroll) and others.

            <h3>WEEKLY PROGRESS</h3>
            <p>
                This week I have started gathering ideas on how to structure the website. I have drawn up a few wireframes to illustrate how I want my website to look. 
                I have already started using links and some semantics on my website but I am more focused on the functionality of my site and the style guide.
            </p>
