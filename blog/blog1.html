        <h3>READING: What Hypertext Is? By Noah Wardrip-Fruin</h3>
        <p>
            From the reading, I gathered that hypertext is essentially a form of media that includes a variety of ways in which text can be utilised. 
            From the scientific perspective, hypertext focuses or relates more towards machine learning and interaction upon request. 
            Wardrip goes on to state that Theodor Holm “Ted” Nelson coined the term Hypertext and was the one who basically defined it as a form of media. 
            Me reading this article made me a bit confused as to what was actually being talked about so I did some side research. 
            According to Technopedia and (please dont shoot me, I really needed an answer) Wikipedia, I was able to deduce that the hypertext being referred to is the current coding language we are being taught to use. 
            Hypertext is basically a language that utilises hyperlinks that are able to display and join different types of media. 
            It’s called a language due to its sequencing and arguments it poses when being used to create a line or paragraph of code. 
            There are similarities to be drawn to other forms of media as presented by Fruin, mainly designing. 
            In order for the hypertext to generate an outcome, one must first have an initial thought or design as to how the end product or result from the text will generate. 
            Same as other forms of media whereby the process has to be mapped out first before the procedure.

        <h3>OVERALL REVIEW OF WEEK 1:</h3>
        <p>
            Week one was mainly focused on setting up and getting to know what html is and how to best utilise it. 
            I had a bit of trouble with setting up GitHub, specifically with linking my account to the school account in order for it to appear on the lecturers end. 
            The main goal for the week was to complete the set up and to start brainstorming ideas on how to best conduct the wireframing of our websites and what we want them to look like. 
            Weaknesses I have so far mostly revolve around GitHub and the online set up but everything else wasnt as bad, especially visual studios. 
            I am personally looking forward to planning out the wireframes and building the website. I feel like with enough time, I'll be able to make a good website and have a steady understanding of GitHub. 
            I'm also looking forward to learning about CSS and styling to make the site more colourful.
