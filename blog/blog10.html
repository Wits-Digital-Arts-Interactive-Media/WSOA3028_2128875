                A notable area of concern is the widening gap in digital footprint among children, related to varying levels of access, usage, and skills influenced by economic differences. The imbalance in digital resources can lead to long-term consequences on academic performance and workforce integration. Engaging digital engagement can pose challenges, blurring boundaries between work and personal life. Mastering digital information becomes advantageous, especially for those in the 'sandwich generation' caring for both young children and elderly parents. Effective digital resource use can ease caregiving burdens, whereas lacking digital skills may worsen challenges. Similarly, in retirement and old age, digital engagement becomes vital for staying connected, yet less educated and economically disadvantaged seniors face barriers in utilizing online channels effectively.

                Regarding gender disparities, although the gap in internet access has narrowed, differences continue to be present in online activities and skills. Women's internet use tends to be less frequent and intense, with lower reported internet skills compared to men. Gender is a factor in digital inequality in terms of skills, content production and representation in IT roles. In terms of race and ethnicity, the article dives into the importance of studying digital inequality to understand how different social groups access technology and how digital engagements influence social disadvantages. Digital inequalities often exacerbate racial and ethnic disparities, reflecting inequality in social networks.
