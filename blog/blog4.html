            <h2>BLOG POST 4: The IxD Process / Headers and Microformats</h2>
            <time datetime="2024-03-08"> 8 March 2024</time>
            <h3>LECTURE MATERIAL</h3>
            <p>
                Going off on what was said last week in the lecture video, this lecture goes on to specify the importance of Document structure and planning. It also explores Headers and formatting, specifically the http and url schemes. 
                In this module, we have already explored the url scheme in the first week when setting up Github. We had to create a directory that could lead us to the Interactive media 3 section in github and add it onto our url. 
                I am still somewhat confused about the naming convention because I did it wrong and only saw a couple of days later that I didn’t use an underscore but used it for the repository that I didn’t add on the IM3 section. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The IxD process was a bit tricky to understand but I inevitably tried my best to do what I thought was being asked of me. I created 2 diagrams that showed the relationship or interaction between my pages. 
                I only covered the main 3 which are the Blog, Design, and Home pages. I did a semi detailed description of each page and what it contains. I thought I would better explain it here instead of a drawing.
            </p>
            <h3>IXD PROCESS DIAGRAM</h3>
            <p>
                So in this diagram I made the root of everything the home page because that’s the first page to pop up when opening the site. Its also the first page to experience changes on the developer side. 
                Within my home page I will first display the title, then information and the links to the next pages. I forgot to draw in that I meant links in the navbar that display the different pages when clicked. 
                I also forgot to add the footer for most pages in the diagram. I plan on including my details and information in the footer as opposed to my original wireframe idea which was to add the navbar there as well, following the apple website design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Blog post section will go under iteration seeing as we haven’t really gotten to css yet but I intend to follow the wireframes to the t. There will be 2 pages for the blog posts, one will be the main display page, the other will expand upon the blog in great detail.
            </p>
