            <h2>BLOG POST 8: DIGITAL DIVIDE WIDENS</h2>

            <p>
                "DIGITAL DEVIDE WIDENS" by Maria Tataki and Dimitris Glynos is an article that disproves the online learning system as the holy grail to future learning and education. With over 1.5 billion students globally affected by school closures, the reliance on e-learning has increased drastically. 
                Despite all of this, UNESCO reports that a staggering 50% of these students lack access to a computer, and 40% are entirely disconnected from the internet. This is also a lot to take in when you realise that there is currently 82% of children in Africa who basically do not have online access to proceed with the school year. 
                Minorities from 1st world countries also don’t have access to technology in that way, which was a huge shock to me.

                The workplace isn’t safe either, with workers that work jobs that don’t have the luxury of remote work have seen the worst parts of having or losing your job. High-earning occupations afford the luxury of remote work, while those in lower-paying sectors face the brunt of job insecurity due to the inability to work from home. 
                Economic challenges further compound this divide, as low-paying sectors that require physical presence bear the brunt of job losses, disproportionately affecting those without a university degree. The pandemic-induced economic turmoil underscores the urgency of bridging the digital gap, as social distancing measures intensify disparities in income and wealth distribution.

                The lancet digital health also states that The COVID-19 pandemic has made existing digital gaps around the world even bigger. In healthcare, the move to using technology for things like online doctor appointments has meant that some people, especially those in rural or underserved areas, can't get the care they need. 
                The shift to online learning in education has also made things harder for students who don't have good internet or computers, especially in communities that are already struggling. These digital gaps don't just stop people from getting important services, they also make existing inequalities worse, because people who don't have access to technology are left behind in a world that relies more and more on digital tools.
