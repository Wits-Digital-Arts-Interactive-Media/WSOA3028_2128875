            <h3>LECTURE AND WEEKLY PROGRESS</h3>
            <p>
                In the lecture video, a range of topics were covered. These topics spanned from the use of Git and Github setup to Dom trees and document Structures. 
                Overall what I got from the video was that semantic markup is basically the practice of using HTML elements to accurately represent the meaning and structure of content on a webpage. 
                I wasn’t quite sure about how to use them and what they were but I was able to use the video as a guide after figuring stuff out by myself using MDN documents and W3 school. 
                I now understand that Semantic markups improve the readability and maintainability of the code.  Learning about the DOM tree put thing into perspective because it made structuring my website a bit easier now knowing what goes where. 
                I also changed from using a lot of sections to using articles for my blog post structuring. I removed a bunch navs in order to make the code neater, taking some advice I have received from an IM 4th year lecturer. 
                I utilised the header system due to the fact that we haven’t really started with css yet and I almost made the mistake of using h1 for every heading I had in order to make them bold and big. 
                Overall there were a lot of changes made from my initial website that I was building last week but in terms of structuring, I feel like I have made good improvements. 
                I have missed a couple of in class lectures but I made up for it by exploring more tags and markups. I included a time tag that tells the date of the different blog posts written and used the h3 for sub headings and h2 for each week’s title.
