            <h3>Reflection on the project</h3>
            <p>
                One of the main challenges I've faced is ensuring that the design remains intuitive and user-friendly across different screen sizes. This involves using CSS to adjust layouts, images, and text sizes. There’s a constant need to balance aesthetics with functionality. One of the main challenges I've faced is ensuring that the design remains intuitive and user-friendly across different screen sizes. This involves using CSS to adjust layouts, images, and text sizes. There’s a constant need to balance aesthetics with functionality. . In one of my projects, I remember spending hours tweaking the CSS to ensure that a complex grid layout worked seamlessly on both a computer screen and a tiny smartphone screen. It was a painstaking process of trial and error, this is something I’ve yet to master.

                One aspect I’ve become more conscious of is accessibility. Ensuring that my websites are accessible to people with disabilities is a form of digital inclusion. This means adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Additionally, I’ve started to think more critically about the data I collect and how it is used. The idea of techno-colonialism, highlights how AI and digital technologies can perpetuate control and exploitation, particularly in the Global South.

                My journey in web development has been as much about self-discovery as it has been about mastering the technical skills. Understanding how CSS relates to HTML and JavaScript, grappling with the challenges of responsive design, and reflecting on the broader impacts of my work has made me a more conscientious and responsible developer.
